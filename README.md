## An appliance scheduler that minimizes emissions

Using data from WattTime, a supplier of real-time data on electricity system emissions, this software will automate the use of appliances through the operation of smart switches such that emissions are minimized without any impact on user experience.

We don't need price signals to minimize our emissions, or to turn off all our energy-hogging appliances and retreat to the woods. We can do it better, easier!
